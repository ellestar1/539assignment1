	<h2>Well Hello There!</h2>

<p>Hello there! We’re B & E Games. Founded in 2015, Our mission is to provide you with inspiring games that are still fun at every level. We started with custom mail-order and trade show events and in 2016 expanded into a full retail location in California, USA.
Our focus is to not only provide tried-and-true favorites, but also to explore new territory. Brandon loves to demo all kinds of different games from North America and Europe and Elizabeth explores Asia, Africa and Australia to bring you something new and different each week. We love to see you go home happy with your games, and we hold lots of events - we hope you will join us on games night and that you have natural 20s all the way!</p>

<h2>We’re not here to be the big guy - we’re just B & E Games.</h2>
<p><strong>Why buy from B & E games?</strong></p>
<p>We’re small, and that means we’re personalized. We interact with you the customer and believe in building relationships that benefit us both.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite board game/card game?</strong></p>
<p>That’s tough to answer, but we think the best way is to separate board games by 2 categories - Hasbro/Mattel/ParkerBrothers/etc and everything else, then filter and refine down after that.</p>
